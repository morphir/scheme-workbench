scheme-workbench is a minimalistic repl intented to get rid of the emacs-dependencie that many newcomers face
when entering lisp ground.

It offers 4 imperative features for lisp coding:

1. Parenthesis highligting - makes it easy to properly balance left with right parens.
2. Autoindent according to the lisp standard.
3. Session namespace - when create new bindings, you can remind your self of their names 
4. When you are finished honing your closure, save it to a file. 

example:

in [1]:(define (fact x)
    ..:  (if (= x 0) 1
    ..:      (* x (fact (- x 1)))))

in [2]:(fact 10)
